Project 1 for Group 8

Questions:

What are the areas in Toronto with the highest crime rates?

To begin, the data was imported from the official Toronto Police website:
Link: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/open-data

First step was to analyze the data and sort it by the total number of crimes for each type of crime.

After sorting, it was found that the crime rates were as follows:
1- Assault: 161,833 entries.
2- Theft from motor vehicle: 76,914 entries.
3- Breaking and entering: 56,466 entries.


Second step was to figure out the crime rates in Toronto neighbourhoods for each type.
