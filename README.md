<h2>Project Description:</h2>
This application is written in Python. The user needs to install or run locally in a machine the CSV files. The API key that are available in the URL did not retrieve the full data. With this project you will identify the types of crime that happened in Toronto. The data retrieved in the CSV files are from 2014 to 2022. Data analysis included the top 3 crimes based on the premises type (outside, houses, apartment, commercial, etc) they happened, the timeline for 24 hours trends, the neighbourhoods affected. Finally, predictive data about the expected total number of crimes to happen in 2023 is provided.
